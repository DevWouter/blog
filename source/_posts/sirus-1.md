Since my birth, we always had a dog in our household. And it was a running gag that we would visit our parents to see the dog and not them. So when our previous dog passed away it wasn't a question of if we should take a fourth dog, but more a question of when. Or so I thought.

My parents have reached a respectable age, a nice euphemism for being old. And because of their age, they worried whether they should take a fourth dog. At the same time, they were also missing a dog in their life. 

We don't take dog ownership lightly. So my parents and I have made an agreement that I will be the owner of the dog while they take care of him. This provided them with the peace of mind they needed for another canine family member.

Next was the question of getting a dog. So we contacted a licensed breeder and explained our situation to them. They know each of us personally and thought it was a great idea. They just had a new litter, but they were all reserved, but we were first in line for the next one.

Two months later we got a call that one of their dogs might be pregnant. And we were thrilled with the prospect that within 3~4 months we might meet a new member of the family. We were still grieving our previous dog and just hearing this brightened our day.

A week later my mom got another call. She feared that there was no pregnancy (this can happen). But no, the dog was pregnant, but the breeder wanted to ask something else: A puppy from the previous litter was returned. Would we be interested in becoming his new owners?

After a bit of debating, we concluded that we were very interested and so we went to pick him up the next day. He is a bolt of energy and loves to hug. We named him Sirus, a reference to Sirius the brightest star in the Canis Major constellation. He has been a family member for four months now and he is everything we hoped for and more.

A quick note about returning a dog: I believe one should not think lightly about "taking a dog". They require a 24-hour commitment, just like a baby. But unlike a baby, they never grow up or leave the house.
But even after careful consideration, an owner might be forced to recognize it simply doesn't work. This is a tragedy for all involved. The dog, but also the owner. 
I strongly believe that returning the dog to the breeder is an act of courage and strength. It's not abandoning a dog, it's providing the dog a better future.
