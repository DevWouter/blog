A question a lot of developers hate: When is it finished? A lot of developers think estimations are useless. An excerise in frustration. But is making estimations useless? 

<!-- more -->

Lets start by saying at one point I also thought estimations was useless. When I made them they could be highly inaccurate and as such when somebody asks the question "When do you think it's finished?"

I'm talking in the past tense since I honestly believe making an estimation is really useful. There are however a few conditions when making estimates.

<!-- TODO: Write out the conditions -->

The first one is to stop thinking of it as an estimate and start thinking of it as scheduling. 

But like any skill the more often you do it, the better you will get it at.
